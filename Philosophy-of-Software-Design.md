### Chapter 2:The Nature of Complexity
#### Complexity shows itself in 3 ways: 
1. Change amplification - small changes requires code changes in many different places.
2. Cognitive load - how much a developer needs to know in order to complete a task. Less lins of code doesn't equate to less cognititve load.
3. Unknown unknow -  it is unclear what to do or whether a proposed solution will even work.

#### Causes of complexity 
1. dependencies - make dependencies as simple and obvious as possible 
2. obscurity - The best way to reduce obscurity is by simplifying the system design.

Complexity comes from an accumulation of dependencies and obscurities. As complexity increases, it leads to change amplification, a high cognitive load, and unknown unknowns.
